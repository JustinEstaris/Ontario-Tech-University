            Basketball is a team sport in which two teams, most commonly of five
            players each, opposing one another on a rectangular court, compete
            with the primary objective of shooting a basketball (approximately
            9.4 inches (24 cm) in diameter) through the defender's hoop (a
            basket 18 inches (46 cm) in diameter mounted 10 feet (3.048 m) high
            to a backboard at each end of the court) while preventing the
            opposing team from shooting through their own hoop.

            A field goal is worth two points, unless made from behind the
            three-point line, when it is worth three. After a foul, timed play
            stops and the player fouled or designated to shoot a technical foul
            is given one or more one-point free throws. The team with the most
            points at the end of the game win. Players advance the ball by
            bouncing it while walking or running (dribbling) or by passing it to
            a teammate, both of which require considerable skill. On offense,
            players may use a variety of shotsâ€”the lay-up, the jump shot, or a
            dunk; on defense, they may steal the ball from a dribbler, intercept
            passes, or block shots; either offense or defense may collect a
            rebound, that is, a missed shot that bounces from rim or backboard.
            It is a violation to lift or drag one's pivot foot without dribbling
            the ball, to carry it, or to hold the ball with both hands then
            resume dribbling.

            Invented in 1891 by Canadian-American gym teacher James Naismith in
            Springfield, Massachusetts, United States, basketball has evolved to
            become one of the world's most popular and widely viewed sports.[1]
            The National Basketball Association (NBA) is the most significant
            professional basketball league in the world in terms of popularity,
            salaries, talent, and level of competition.[2][3] Outside North
            America, the top clubs from national leagues qualify to continental
            championships such as the Euroleague and FIBA Americas League. The
            FIBA Basketball World Cup and Men's Olympic Basketball Tournament
            are the major international events of the sport and attract top
            national teams from around the world. Each continent hosts regional
            competitions for national teams, like EuroBasket and FIBA AmeriCup.
