## Course Description
This course provides a detailed study of the compilation process for a procedural language. 

Students will develop an understanding of compiler design and put these principles into practice through the construction of a fully functioning compiler for a small procedural language using widely available tools for compiler construction and a general-purpose programming language.

## Learning Outcomes
1. Understand context free grammar
2. Be able to design and parse syntax for programming languages
3. Understand of parsing algorithms and parser generating libraries
4. Understand code generation
5. Be able to implement a compiler of a simple language
