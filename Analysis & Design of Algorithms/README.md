## Course Description
This course exposes students to the following:
* Fundamental techniques for designing efficient computer algorithms
* Proving algorithm correctness
* Analyzing algorithm complexity. 

It provides students with the expertise to analyze the cost of solving a specific problem with a given algorithm. Classical algorithms are analyzed in detail and their relative performance (depending on the size of the problem) predicted. Generic efficient techniques such as recursion divide and conquer, greedy strategies and branch and bound are studied and their relative costs identified. 

## Learning Outcomes
* Design and implement efficient algorithms using a variety of techniques
* Analyze the efficiency of existing algorithms
* Implement and understand algorithms for solving well-known problems
* Implement and understand advanced data structures
* Compare algorithms
* Understand the classes of algorithms and the P vs. NP open question
