### Assignment Breakdown

| Part Number |Algorithm |Description   |
| ------------ | ------------ |------------ |
|Part 1 |Minimum Edit Distance (MED)| Implement the Minimum Edit Distance (MED) using Dynamic Programming |
|Part 2 |Radix Sort | Implement a radix sort procedure for sorting numbers between 0 (inclusive) and 1,000,000 (exclusive) |
|Part 3 |Fractional Knapsack| Implement a greedy algorithm to solve the fractional knapsack problem, described as the following: Given a number of items with weight and value, select a percentage (0.0-1.0) for each item(s) to include in your knapsack such that the weight capacity (W) of the knapsack is not exceeded, and the total value (V, the sum of the value of all included items) is maximal.  |
|Part 4 |Huffman Coding | Implement a greedy implementation of assigning prefix codes (Huffman coding) |
