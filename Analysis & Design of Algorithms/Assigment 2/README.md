### Assignment Breakdown

| Part Number |Description   |
| ------------ | ------------ |
|Part 1 | Implement the Minimum Edit Distance (MED) using Dynamic Programming |
|Part 2 | Implement a radix sort procedure for sorting numbers between 0 (inclusive) and 1,000,000 (exclusive) |
|Part 3 | Implement a greedy algorithm to solve the fractional knapsack problem, as described below: 

> Given a number of items with weight and value, select a percentage (0.0-1.0) for each item(s) to include in your knapsack such that the weight capacity (W) of the knapsack is not exceeded, and the total value (V, the sum of the value of all included items) is maximal.  |
|Part 4 | Implement a greedy implementation of assigning prefix codes (Huffman coding) |
