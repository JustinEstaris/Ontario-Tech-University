* Heap Sort
* Divide and Conquer


### Assignment Breakdown

| Part Number |Description   |
| ------------ | ------------ |
|Part 1     | Find the upper bounds using O(n) notation using the following techniques: <ul><li>Recrusion Tree</li><li>Substituion Method</li><li>Master Method</li></ul>|
|Part 2 | Order the following functions by their order of growth (Highest to Lowest)  |
|Part 3 | Using divide and conquer, create an algorithm to solve the problem that follows: You have a long string containing many characters (such as this paragraph), and you want to search for a substring within this string. For example, one may want to search for “characters” or “want to” or “bstring wi” or “language”. 

All but the last example should be found. |
|Part 4 | Implement the heap data structure and use it to implement a heap sort|
