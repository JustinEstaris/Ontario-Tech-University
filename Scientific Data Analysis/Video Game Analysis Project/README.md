# Video Game Analysis Project
A Jupyter notebook whos goal  is to test whether a rating from a game review website has a direct relationship to it's sales. 

We will be using American game reviews to compare with global sales data broken down into regions. Some of the big questions we're trying to answer are: 
* Does an American game review affect sales in North America/Europe/Japan
* Does a good review always mean good sales?
* Does a bad review always mean bad sales?
* Do reviewers favour a specific Platform?
* What games are the greatest of all time (best review and sales).
