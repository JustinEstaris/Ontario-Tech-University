## Course Description
The principal goal of this course is to build computational skills required for analyzing scientific data in a variety of data formats (e.g. CSV, text, binary, sound, image, etc.). 

Topics include: 
* Automation of data analysis tasks using command-line user interfaces (e.g., the Unixshell)
* Managing code and data using a version control system
* Modular programming for scientific data analysis
* Debugging and testing scientific software
* Plotting data (i.e., two- andthree-dimensional graphics).

## Learning Outcomes
1. Able to develop programs to perform data analysis
2. Understand different methods in data inspection, analysis and reporting
3. Develop working knowledge of state-of-art programming languages and libraries for data analytics
4. Understand the benefit and risk of data-driven decision making
5. Able to work with time proven workflow and software development methodologies for the purpose of data analytics
