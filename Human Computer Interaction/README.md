## Course Description
The primary purpose of this course is to introduce students to human-computer interaction (HCI) and the development of user interfaces. 

Students will understand the relationships between humans and computers and will learn how to design, implement and evaluate user interfaces. 

Students will also gain deeper knowledge about HCI concepts through case studies and in-class discussion.
