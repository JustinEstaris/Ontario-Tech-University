## Course Description
This course is an introduction to Computer Graphics. The first objective of this course is to familiarize the students with the basic theory, practice and techniques of Computer Graphics as a background for the implementation of this knowledge on computer graphics programming. 

The main topics include:
* Graphics I/O devices characteristics
* Basic graphics architecture
* Pipeline
* Projections, rendering, shaders and color
* 2D/3D Transformations 
* Texturing and lighting

The course will also provide the students with the knowledge to use the OpenGL API in order to develop Computer Graphics applications.

## Learning Outcomes
1.	Recognize and implement the fundamental computer graphics theory, terms and concepts.
2.	Explain the basics of graphics hardware and pipelines.
3.	Understand and use the OpenGL Graphics Pipeline.
4.	Develop Computer Graphics applications using OpenGL.
5.	Identify and use software packages that assist with the production of graphics applications.
6.	Apply Transformations, Texturing, Geometric modelling techniques and Lighting into graphical scenes.
7.	Describe the theory underlying ray tracing techniques and implement a simple ray tracer to render a scene.
8.	Understand and implement the visual representation of color.
9.	Apply graphical techniques to the display of different types of data.
10.	Explain the most important advances in graphics hardware, including GPU programming, and relate them to the most challenging problems in the discipline.
