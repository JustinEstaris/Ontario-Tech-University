## Course Description
There are two dominant themes in this course: 
1. Programming applied to scientific computing
2. The theory and development of numerical algorithms. 

Using the scientific problem-solving environment provided by Python, we will develop an understanding of the numerical computations that arise in many scientific problems and of their mathematical analysis. In particular, we will consider for a number of basic algorithms under what conditions they provide answers, how efficiently they do so and how accurate the results are.

The topics include:
> - Basic numerical linear algebra 
> - Interpolation 
> - Nonlinear root-finding 
> - Quadrature
> - The solution of initial-value problems for ordinary differential equations

## Course Outcomes
Upon completing this course you will be able to implement a number of basic computational algorithms in Python.  You will understand how to evaluate the efficiency and accuracy of these algorithms using theoretical arguments as well as visualization, and how to combine them to perform more complex computations. 

> In short, the ability to numerically  approximate solutions to mathematical problems and visualize data.
