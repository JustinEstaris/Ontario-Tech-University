## Lab Description
This lab conducts a market-basket analysis by developing and comparing experimentally various frequent itemset algorithms. The goal is to find frequent pairs and triples of elements and analyze the results using Python.

### Algorithms Implemented
* Apriori
* PCY (Park, Chen, Yu)
* Random Sampling
* SON (Savasere, Omiecinski, Navathe)

### Dataset
This lab uses an anonymized retail market basket data (~88200) from an anonymous Belgian retail store (http://fimi.ua.ac.be/data/retail.dat) 

### Lab Schedule
